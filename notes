What is CHIP-8 ?

>a programming language
>built for game dev on 8-bits
>small set of instruction, really simple, good doc and large community
>idal for begginner

CHIP-8 != emulator (even though we call it like this) but a language, so we are building a CHIP-8 interpreter

= Compact Hexadecimal Interpretive Programming - 8 bits

CHIP-8 programs are binary files

The "emulator" will read them and operate on the bytes

We will use the SDL to draw pixels

Specs

Memory : 4 kilobytes of RAM (4096 bytes)
Display : 64x32 piels, monochrome
Program counter : PC (pointer to the current instruction in mem)
One 16-bit index regiester (I) to poiont at lcoations in mem
A stack for 16 bit addresses (to call subroutines/function and return from them
An 8 bit delay timer which is decremented at a rate of 60 hz (60 tiimes per secod) until 0
An 8 bit sound timer, same as delay but beeping when it's not 0
16 8-bit general purpose varibale registers from 0 to F (V0 to VF) -> VF also used as a flag register

Fiest chip 8 interpreter (on COSMAC VIP) would expect a program to be loaded into mem from address 200 (512 in base 10).

Font

Builtin font representing hexa from 0 to F. Each font = 4 pixels wide by 5 pixels tall

Font stored in mem (it's like sprites)

To set I to char addr, you need to put it in the first 512 bytes (000 - 1FF).

Convention put it at 050 - 09F
